				<td class="content">
					<p>
						This release of <em>hale studio</em> improves the integration
						with the online collaboration platform <i>hale connect</i> in
						a couple of ways. Firstly, it is now possible to select which
						organisation should own an uploaded transformation project for
						cases where the currently logged-in user is member of more than
						one organisation. Furthermore, <em>hale studio</em> now supports
						a relogin with same or different credentials without having to
						clear the credentials stored in preferences.

				<td class="title">Enhanced CRS selection dialog</td>
				<td class="content">
					<p>
					    When loading source data, the user is prompted to provide the 
					    CRS of the contained coordinates. <em>hale studio</em> now 
					    facilitates this by providing the content of the <em>srsName</em>
					    attribute (in case of a GML source) or the WKT definition found
					    in the projection file (<i>.prj</i>) that accompanies a Shape 
					    file. This allows the user to select the correct CRS without
					    having to manually look up this information in the source files.

				<td class="title">Character set detection for Shapefiles</td>
				<td class="content">
					<p>
						Importing a schema or source data from a Shapefile requires
						the user to select the encoding of the Shapefile. In cases
						where the Shape is accompanied by a Codepage file (<i>.cpg</i>),
						<em>hale studio</em> can now read the encoding from that file
						a prefill the character set selection dialog.
