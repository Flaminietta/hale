	<h1>Tasks View</h1>
	<p>
		The <i>Tasks View</i> provides a list of tasks and messages associated 
		with cells in the alignment. The list is structured hierarchically,
		with <i>Cell Messages</i> being the top-level node and a list of cells
		that have messages associated beneath. Every cell entry then can be
		expanded to show the list of associated messages.
	</p>
	<p>
		Every cell message comes with a status that can be changed by clicking 
		the status in the list and selecting a new status from the dropdown. 
		Status changes are persisted in the alignment once the project is saved.
	</p>

	<p>
		All cells that have at least one associated uncompleted message will
		have a tasks icon attached. When selecting such a cell in the Alignment 
		view, the corresponding list entry in the Tasks view will also be
		selected and the associated messages shown.
