<title>XtraServer Plug-in for <i>hale studio</i> - XtraServer compatibility mode</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h1>XtraServer compatibility mode</h1>
	<p>
	To help the user discern which functions are compatible with an XtraServer mapping and which are not, an XtraServer compatibility mode has been added to hale studio.
	</p>
	<p>
	Once the mode is activated, the mapping function selection menu in the schema explorer view will only list the functions which are compatible with the XtraServer mapping, and a red cross will appear at the bottom right corner of the window if the alignment cannot be automatically translated to XtraServer mapping.
