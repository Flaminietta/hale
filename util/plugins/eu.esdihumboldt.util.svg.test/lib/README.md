Classpath libraries
-------------------

These libraries are provided here to avoid conflicts in the Test product with different [Apache Batik](https://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/) versions.

The version of the libraries provided here is 1.8.

Previously 1.6.1 was used, but there was a bug with rendering of Arcs with more than 180Â° to SVG.
